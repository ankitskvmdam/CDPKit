master:

 - For conformer generation rotatable bond count dependent values can now be specified for min. RMSD, energy window and
   max. ensemble size
 - The output conformer ensemble compilation process now strives for higher energetic diversity among the picked conformers which, on average,
   leads to higher accuracy in the reproduction of experimental structures
 - Update of the torsion library used for systematic conformer generation
 - The pharmacophore screening application 'psdscreen' provides a new option '--unique-hits'
   which enforces that a database molecule matched by multiple query pharmacophores is saved only once to the output hit list
 - Fix for a bug in the SMARTS-pattern parser that lead to the storage of wrong bond directions
 - Bond direction specifications (up/down) in SMILES and SMARTS string are now correctly interpreted
 - Support for the XYZ file format 
 - Systematic conformer sampling speed optimizations
 - Significant reduction of the long-term memory consumption during conformer generation
 - Fixed a bug that may lead to the generation of conformers with wrong geometries at exocyclic double bonds
 - Refactoring of stereochemistry related code
 - New command line application 'isogen' for the enumeration of R/S and E/Z stereoisomers of molecules
 - New class (Chem::StereoisomerGenerator) for the exhaustive enumeration of R/S and E/Z stereoisomers
 - New 2D drawing primitives (Vis::Path2D and Vis::PathPrimitive2D) and support for clipping operations
 - Fixed a bug in the 'shapescreen' tool that lead to the calculation of erroneous similarity scores
   in the 'score-only' screening mode
 - Fix for a minor bug that affected the indentation of SD-file property entries
 - New class (Chem::BemisMurckoAnalyzer) for the extraction of Bemis-Murcko scaffolds
 - New functions for conformer alignment
 - Function overload resolution order fixes in the CDPL.Math Python package
 - Prevented the throwing of exceptions when the env. variable LC_ALL has not been initialized
 - Python exports of Util::Map and Util::MultiMap do not provide the properties 'keys', 'values', and 'entries' anymore.
   They were replaced by the corresponding methods keys(), values() and items()
 - MolProp::getAtomCount() function has been extended by a 'strict' argument which, if set to 'false', instructs
   the accounting procedure to regard the meaning of generic atom types (e.g. any halogen)
 - New utility functions Chem::calcBasicProperties() enabling a more comfortable initialization of Chem::MolecularGraph
   and Chem::Reaction instances for further processing
 - CDPL Python bindings code cleanup
 - CDPL API cleanup
 - When deep copying Chem::Reaction or Chem::Molecule instances, values of properties referencing atoms and/or bonds (e.g. stereodescriptors, SSSR)
   now get automatically translated to values referencing the corresponding atoms/bonds of the copying target
 - GRAIL::GRAIL(X)DescriptorCalculator now only considers heavy atoms for the calculation of
   environment HBA/HBD occupation scores which do not represent a complementary feature type
 - New class GRAIL::GRAILDescriptorCalculator now calculates a shorter descriptor (35 elements) with
   not further subdivided H-bond donor/acceptor feature types
 - Old class GRAIL::GRAILDescriptorCalculator renamed into GRAILXDescriptorCalculator
