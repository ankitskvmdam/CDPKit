Installation Instructions
*************************

For a successful build of CDPKit the following packages
have to be installed on the build host:

- a c++11 compliant compiler (mandatory)
- cmake (V >= 3.17, mandatory)
- boost-devel C++ libraries (V >= 1.52, mandatory)
- Qt5-devel (optional)
- cairo-devel (V >= 1.14, optional)
- python-devel 3.x (optional) and Python-interpreter (mandatory)
- sqlite-devel V3 (optional)
- sphinx (V >= 4.5, optional)
- sphinx-rtd-theme (optional)
- sphinxcontrib-bibtex (optional)
- doxygen (V >= 1.8.5, optional)

CDPKit requires CMake V3.17 or higher for generating 
build makefiles. The makefiles are generated as follows
(assuming a Linux build):

> mkdir <BUILD-DIR>
> cd <BUILD-DIR>
> cmake <CDPKIT-SOURCE-DIR>

If the makefiles have been generated without errors, invoking
'make' from within <BUILD-DIR> starts the actual build process: 

> make

Building CDPKit should proceed without any issues at least on RHEL 7/8 based systems 
(should also work on other current systems with minor configuration tweaks). 

If the build finished without errors

> make install

will install CDPKit in the /opt directory of your system (please refer to
the CMake documentation for how to change the default path).


* Generating CDPKit documentation:

For a successful build of the CDPKit documentation pages, sphinx, the sphinx-rtd-theme and sphinxcontrib-bibtex
need to be installed on the build host. Furthermore, doxygen has to be available for the generation
of the CDPL C++ and Python API-documentation.

If all prerequisites are fulfilled

> make doc

should lead to a successful build of the CDPKit documentation which can then be found in <BUILD-DIR>/Doc/html.
